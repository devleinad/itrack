<h2><b>How to use it</h2>

NB: I am assuming you are already familiar with at least the basics of Laravel. Otherwise, you can contact me at <b>peprahdaniel.dp@gmail.com</b> for any help or explanations needed. Also, you can visit <a href="https://laravel.com/docs">Laravel</a> and read the documentation.

<h2><b>Database configuration</b></h2>

First and foremost, open the.env file and make changes to the following to suit your system
<ul>
  <li>DB_CONNECTION=your_datasource_connection(eg.mysql)</li>  
  <li>DB_HOST=127.0.0.1</li>  
  <li>DB_PORT=your_datasource_connection_port(eg.3306)</li>  
  <li>DB_DATABASE=your_database</li>  
  <li>DB_USERNAME=your_username</li>  
  <li>DB_PASSWORD=your_password</li>
<ul>

When you are done, make sure you create the database, and run migrations (with artisan command: php artisan migrate)
After running migrations with no errors generated, go ahead and start the server (with artisan command: php artisan serve)
  
Now, there is the need to have a superadmin, so open a browser and visit the url: 127.0.0.1:8000/create_superuser. If no errors/exceptions are thrown, it means you have successfully created a super admin with the following details:
<ul>
  <li>Name: Admin</li>
  <li>Email: superadmin@admin.com</li>
  <li>Designation: IT Technician</li>
  <li>Password:admin</li>
</ul>

You can make changes inside the web/routes.php file, but know that the email has been used to set policy logics, so if you decide to change it, you’d have to visit the various policy files inside <b>app/Policies</b> and change the email there as well.
Also, if you decide to change the email, you’d have to change the email inside the isSuperAdmin() method inside the app/Models/User.php file. The isSuperAdmin() is a method used to check if a user is superadmin or not.

Once the above changes have been made, you may access the dashboard by hitting the url: <b>127.0.0.1/login</b>
Fill out the form with the created superadmin’s email and password, and after a successful request, you shall be redirected to the dashboard. Once you get to the dashboard you will be able to peform various CRUD actions.

NB: only the superadmin will be able to create new items and users. Also, every other user created will not be a super admin, unless you change the logic inside the various policies to include other/specific emails.
It is also only a superadmin that can block and/or delete normal users.
Also, note that only superadmin would be able to view or delete activity logs.
